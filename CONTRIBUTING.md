## How to contribute
#### **Did you find a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub issue if it's not already reported.
* Explain it clearly, with steps (or code) to reproduce it. 

#### **Do you want to create a more complex scenario?**
* Feel free to get community feedback on your idea before you start coding.
* New pull requests adding methods to the library are welcomed.
